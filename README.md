# Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR)

This repository documents my journey in building a Differential Drive AMR using ROS 2.

## Current Stage
- URDF Modeling
- Gazebo Simulation Setup

## Goals
- Stable Differential Drive Robot
- Sensor Integration (LiDAR, Camera)
- SLAM + Navigation Stack
- Autonomous Exploration

## Weekly Progress Logs
All updates are committed weekly to track consistent development.
